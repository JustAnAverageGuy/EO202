## DC Biasing

Transistors are either current amplification devices or transconductance devices, that can be used for applications in voltage amp, power amp, switching, etc.
With regards to anaolg amplifiers, transistors are used to convert a low energy signel (a current or voltage signal) into a high energy signal.

Generally, specific circuit architectures called as dc bias circuits are designed to energize the transistor in amplifier circuits.

In such bias circuits, the transistors are made to operate in specific regions of operation based on the application (e.g. BJT, saturation and cutoff regions for digital switching applications and active regions for amplification applications ).

DC Bias circuits also form an important part in deciding the various parameters of AC operation as well (e.g. parameters like voltage gain, input impedance, outupt impedance etc.)
