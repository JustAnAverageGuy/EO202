# Diode Circuits and Power supplies

## Circuit modelling of PN Junction Diodes
  - Mathematical modelling
    - $I_D = I_0\left[e^{\frac{V_D}{\eta V_T} - 1}\right]$
    - $I_d$ terminal current
    - $V_d$ terminal voltage
    - $V_T$ = $\frac{kT}{q}$
      - $k$ = boltzmann constant
      - $q$ = magnitude charge of electron
      - $T$ = temperature
    - $I_0$ = reverse saturation current
      - Heavy temperature dependence
        - For Si, doubles every 10 degree kelvin
    - $\eta$ = Process Ideality factor
      - For Ge $\approx$ 1
      - For Si $\approx$ 2
      - For other practical diodes in between 1 and 2
      - Caculated based on curve fitting data
  - In Forward Bias: Closed Switch
  - In Reverse Bias: Open Switch
